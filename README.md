This is a Python GUI application built using Tkinter that generates strong random passwords.

It ensures that each password contains at least:

   - One lowercase letter
   - One uppercase letter
   - One digit
   - One special character

The GUI allows the user to:

  - Enter the desired password length.
  - Generate a new random password.
  - Copy the generated password directly to the clipboard.
  - See a colorful, user-friendly interface (random soft background color each run).
